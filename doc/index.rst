The model **RATP** (Radiation Absorption, Transpiration and
Photosynthesis) was designed to simulate the spatial distribution of
radiation and leaf-gas exchanges within vegetation canopies as a
function of canopy structure, canopy microclimate within the canopy and
physical and physiological leaf properties. The model uses a 3D
representation of the canopy (i.e. an array of 3D voxels, each
characterised by a leaf area density) and allows several vegetation
types (e.g. foliage of several plants) to be input at voxel scale.
Radiation transfer is computed by a turbid medium analogy, transpiration
by the leaf energy budget approach, and photosynthesis by the Farquhar
model, each applied for sunlit and shaded leaves at the individual 3D
cell-scale. The model typically operates at a 20 to 30 min time step.
Principes and main equations of the RATP model are given in: [Sinoquet2001]_.

The RATP version 2 is basically implemented as a set of Fortran90
modules, which can be used as a Python library in the OpenAlea
environment. A Fortran90 module includes public variables and
subroutines, which are all accessible in the OpenAlea environment.
